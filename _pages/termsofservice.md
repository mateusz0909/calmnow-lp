### **Terms of Service for Calm Now**

**Last Updated:** August 27, 2025

Welcome to Calm Now. This application (the "App") is owned and operated by **Mateusz Byrtus**. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Calm Now mobile application and any related services (collectively, the "Service").

Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service. By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

**1. Medical Disclaimer**

**Crucially, Calm Now is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice.**

The Service, including all text, audio, video, and other content, is for informational, educational, and entertainment purposes only. The content is designed to support, not replace, the relationship that exists between a user and their physician or other healthcare providers. **Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have experienced through this App.**

The breathing exercises and techniques offered within the App are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new wellness or breathing practice, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition, are pregnant, or have respiratory issues. If you experience a medical emergency, call your doctor or emergency services immediately.

**2. Use of the Service**

*   **Eligibility:** You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Service (or the minimum age required by the laws in your country).
*   **License:** We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use on devices that you own or control, as permitted by the Apple App Store's terms of service.

**3. Subscriptions & Purchases**

The App offers a free-to-use version ("Free Features") and a premium subscription ("Calm Now Premium") that unlocks additional features.

*   **Subscription Plans:** Calm Now Premium is available on a monthly or yearly auto-renewing basis, as well as through a one-time lifetime purchase ("Lifetime Plan").
*   **Payment:** Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.

*   **Cancellation:** You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase. If you cancel, you will continue to have access to the premium features until the end of your current billing period.
*   **Refunds:** All purchases, including subscriptions and the Lifetime Plan, are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or as determined by Apple in its sole discretion. We do not issue refunds for unused portions of a subscription.
*   **Pricing Changes:** We reserve the right to modify subscription fees at any time. We will provide you with reasonable notice of any price changes by posting the new prices on or through the App.

**9. Changes to These Terms**

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make changes, we will post the revised Terms in the App and update the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
